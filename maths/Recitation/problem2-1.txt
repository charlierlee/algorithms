Perhaps you encountered this classic formula in school:
1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + . . . + r^n = 1 - r^(n+1) / 1âˆ’r

First use the well ordering principle, and 
 then induction, to prove that this formula 
 is correct for all real values r != 1

16/b = 4 IMPLIES b = 4
16/b = 8 IMPLIES b = 2
16/b = 16 IMPLIES b = 1
16/b = 32 IMPLIES b = 1/2
(a/b) = r IMPLIES a = r * b

R0 = 1
R1 = 1 + r
R2 = 1 + r + r^2
R3 = 1 + r + r^2 + r^3

(1-r^(2+1))/(1-r) = R2 IMPLIES (1-r^3) = R2 * (1-r)

(1-r^3) = R2 * (1-r)
(1-r^3) = (1 + r + r^2) * (1-r)
(1-r^3) = 1(1-r)+r(1-r)+r^2(1-r)
(1-r^3) = 1-r+r-r^2+r^2-r^3
(1-r^3) = 1 - r^3

Todo: 
Use induction to prove from n==2 to n as any real number
Prove that the formula is correct for all real values r!=1
